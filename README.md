# README

Hey! You're currently looking at the repository of my personal blog available at [1823.pl](https://1823.pl).
Besides the source markup of all my articles, you can also check out how the whole thing is built.

The [build script](./build.php) is implemented in PHP, leveraging it as a template language to render the blog and its [RSS feed](https://1823.pl/feed.xml).
It's relatively small and heavily commented so feel free to take a look.
